# CNN-CLASSIFIER #
This is a generic convolutional model which can train a set of images and predict a output of it.In this project I have collected a set of christmas object images and developed a model and trained it.Now from a picture it can predict whether it is realted to christmas or not.Since it is generic you can able to use this model for various scenarios.

## Python Library Dependencies ##
  
+ [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)   
+ [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

## LINK FOR THE TRAINING IMAGE SOURCE ##

**Core Functionality**
+ `preprocess.py` - Process the image dataset to the required format
+ `imageagument.py` - Agumenting the image to get improve the accuracy
+ `christmas.tfrecords` - Its a representation of image dataset in a well structured format 
+ `train.py` - Deploying and Training the model
