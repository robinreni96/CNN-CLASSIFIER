# CNN-CLASSIFIER
This is a generic convolutional model which can train a set of images and predict a output of it.In this project I have collected a set of christmas object images and developed a model and trained it.Now from a picture it can predict whether it is realted to christmas or not.Since it is generic you can able to use this model for various scenarios.

## Python Library Dependencies ##
  
+ [Tensorlflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)   
+ [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
